        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>Lencho‚Äôs Hope for a Good Harvest:</strong> Lencho, a farmer, lived with his family on a low hill in the valley‚Äôs only house. His field was full of ripe corn, clearly visible from his home. He eagerly awaited rain, hoping for a good harvest to earn money and support his family.</p>
        <p><strong>Lencho‚Äôs Hope Turns to Despair :</strong> As Lencho wished, it began raining during supper, bringing him joy. He stepped outside to feel the rain, which he imagined as coins falling from the sky. However, the weather changed suddenly, and hailstones accompanied strong winds, destroying the crops. Within an hour, his field was covered in a white layer of hail.</p>
        <p><strong>Lencho‚Äôs Unshakable Faith in God:</strong> Despite losing his crops, Lencho‚Äôs faith in God remained firm. Seeing God as his only hope, he wrote a letter asking for a hundred pesos to replant his fields and support his family. He believed that without divine help, his family would starve.</p>
        <p><strong>Lencho‚Äôs Letter to God:</strong> ‚ÄúGod, if you don‚Äôt help me, my family will go hungry this year. I need a hundred pesos to reseed my field and survive until the next harvest, as the hailstorm has destroyed everything.‚Äù
        <p><strong>Lencho Receives the Money:</strong> The following Sunday, Lencho returned to the post office, where the postman handed him the letter. Lencho was initially pleased to receive the money but grew angry after counting it. He had requested a hundred pesos but received only seventy.
        <p><strong>The Postmaster‚Äôs Kind Gesture:</strong> A postman discovered Lencho‚Äôs letter and laughed at its unusual address. He showed it to the postmaster, who was kind and understanding. Touched by Lencho‚Äôs unwavering faith, the postmaster decided to help by collecting money to send to Lencho.</p>
        <p><strong>Lencho Writes Again:</strong> Certain that God couldn‚Äôt make a mistake, Lencho wrote another letter. After posting it, the postmaster read it. ‚ÄúGod: Of the money I requested, only seventy pesos reached me. Please send the rest, but don‚Äôt send it through the mail, as the post office employees are a bunch of crooks.‚Äù.</p>

        <h2>Character Sketches</h2>
        <div class="character-box">
            <h3>Lencho</h3>
            <p>Lencho is a hardworking farmer who deeply relies on nature for his livelihood. He has unwavering faith in God and believes that divine help will rescue him in times of need. When a hailstorm destroys his crops, he writes a letter to God, requesting financial aid. His innocence and blind trust in divine intervention make him a unique character. He is simple, honest, and somewhat na√Øve, as he fails to recognize the true source of the money he receives. His disappointment in the ‚Äúdishonest‚Äù post office employees, despite their kindness, highlights his rigid belief system. Lencho represents the resilience and faith of poor farmers who depend entirely on nature and God for survival. His story underscores themes of faith, hope, and human kindness, even when misunderstood.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character-box">
            <h3>The Postmaster</h3>
            <p>The postmaster is a kind-hearted and generous man who empathizes with Lencho‚Äôs plight. Upon receiving Lencho‚Äôs letter to God, he is deeply moved by the farmer‚Äôs faith and decides to help. He collects money from his colleagues and contributes his own earnings to fulfill Lencho‚Äôs request. His actions highlight his compassionate and selfless nature. Despite Lencho‚Äôs misunderstanding‚Äîbelieving the post office staff stole part of the money‚Äîhe does not seek recognition or gratitude. He represents the unseen kindness in humanity, proving that acts of goodness can exist without the need for acknowledgment. His character is a contrast to Lencho‚Äôs innocence, as he understands the harsh realities of life but still chooses to be generous. His role in the story emphasizes themes of empathy, selflessness, and silent charity.</p>
